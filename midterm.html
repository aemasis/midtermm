    <h2> Sale Policies </h2>
  <h3> Twelve Book Policy </h3>
    <p>
     We have a sale policy of no more than twelve books per shopper before noon, due to the high number of shoppers. 
     The limitation continues after noon if there is still a line outside. 
     Once there is no longer a line outside, shoppers may purchase more than twelve books. 
    </p>
    <h3> Line Policy</h3>
     <p> The sales line operates on a numbered ticket system. Shoppers may begin to line up at 8 am to receive their tickets, which hold their spot in line, enabling them to leave the           sale and return when the doors open. 
        There is a two ticket per person limit.
